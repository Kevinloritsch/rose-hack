## Setup
If you have ruby-on-rails installed (can be checked by running `ruby -v` and `rails -v`), then simply run `./bin/dev` like any other rails app to start the server.

## Inspiration
UC Riverside has a database known as Highlander Link which is made for the purpose of giving UCR students access to all the clubs on campus. It is advertised time and time again on various offical school websites. As students, we have made attempts to use Highlander Link to find clubs and events suitable for our interest. While using it, we found it to have a cluttered UI and barely give relevant information (for example, when searching Hackathon cuite hack, rose hack and citrus hack all fail to show up). Our hope is to revamp this page to create a cleaner, better looking, and more accessable user interface for both the students and the clubs. 

## What it does
Our project compiles all the events and details of engineering clubs on campus to create an engineering specific database. It then allows the user to filter their search by common topics (for example, hackathons, computer science, and design) to provide easy access with what they are looking for. It alsoo makes it easy for clubs to edit their information which will hopefully lead to more accurate and updated information.

## How we built it
Our website was built with a combination of Ruby and Tailwind CSS. The Ruby was used for Backend functionality and Tailwind was used to create our style elements.

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges that we ran into were trying to figure out how to use Tailwind to create certain effects and correct spacing. We also ran into the challenge of not having enought time to implement all of our ideas (both for design and for functionality) on this website. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the back end functionality of the website and some specific design elements. 

## What we learned
We learned how to collaborate and work together in merging our various front end and back end development abilities to create a project.

## What's next for Highlander Stem Clubs
If we had more time to work on this project, we would work to improve some of the various back end functionalities. For example, dates on the events are currently gibberish with no validations, and are not ordered in any way. Furthermore, anyone is able to access and edit club information, which should be updated with permissions.
